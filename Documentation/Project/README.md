## üéØ Project Objective

```markdown
Proposed exercise:
"We envision ourselves as a company dedicated to capturing data from street surveys. We have a team of individuals stationed at various locations, using tablets or smartphones to ask passersby a series of questions. These responses are then sent to a central server where the information is stored.

The survey consists of questions designed to gauge whether the respondent might be interested in a product we plan to market in the near future. The questions can be answered in various ways - a simple yes/no, a short answer, a rating, etc.

Our goal is to create the infrastructure and client/server developments to support our company's survey capture needs. Additionally, we aim to effectively manage the project, the code, and the generated documentation."

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

VistaQs utilizes the following stack:

| Area     | Technology           |
|----------|----------------------|
| Frontend | Angular 17.2         |
| Backend  | PHP 8.2.12           |
|          | Laravel 10.43.0      |
| Database | PostgreSQL           |

Deployment of the application is managed using Docker. The application is divided into three separate containers:

1. **Frontend Container**: Houses the Angular application.
2. **Backend Container**: Contains the PHP and Laravel backend.
3. **Database Container**: Manages the PostgreSQL database.

Each container has its own Dockerfile, and a main Docker Compose file is used to orchestrate the building and running of these containers.
